Source directory used for Grunt automation:
 * `views/` - Templates used by Jade to create the static pages
 * `js/` - Javascript files checked by jshint
 * `css/` - CSS files checked by csslint
 * `assets/` - Any static content that is not processed. This directory is simply copied over to the output directory, maintaining the directory structure.
