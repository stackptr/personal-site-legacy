x64 website
====

My personal website, running on a low-powered server. Basically an excuse to gain some exposure to Node.js and other cool new technologies. The goal is to create a minimal, attractive space for some personal information that is easy to maintain and extend.

Server:
 * Grunt.js
 * Jade

Web:
 * Bootstrap
 * jQuery
 * WebFont Loader
 * Font Awesome

Todo:
 * Switch from nginx to a Node.js-based server
 * Use LESS instead of static CSS
 * Compile bootstrap js/less
 * Layout should be standardized between front page and subpages (page nav moves from middle to left)
 * Grid is buggy: span12 results in overflow. Possible margin error in CSS
